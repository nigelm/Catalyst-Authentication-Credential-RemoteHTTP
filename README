NAME
    Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::RemoteHTTP - Authenticate against
    remote HTTP server

VERSION
    Version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/
          Authentication
          /;

        package MyApp::Controller::Auth;

        sub login : Local {
            my ( $self, $c ) = @_;

            $c->authenticate( { username => $c->req->param('username'),
                                password => $c->req->param('password') });
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This authentication credential checker takes authentication information
    (most often a username) and a password, and attempts to validate the
    username and password provided against a remote http server - ie against
    another web server.

    This is useful for environments where you want to have a single source
    of authentication information, but are not able to conveniently use a
    networked authentication mechanism such as LDAP.

CONFIGURATION
        # example
        __PACKAGE__->config(
            'Plugin::Authentication' => {
                        default_realm => 'members',
                        realms => {
                            members => {
                                credential => {
                                    class => 'RemoteHTTP',
                                    url => 'http://intranet.company.com/authenticated.html',
                                    password_field => 'password',
                                    username_prefix => 'MYDOMAIN\\',
                                    http_keep_alive => 1,
                                    defer_find_user => 1,
                                },
                                ...
                        },
            },
        );

    class
        The classname used for Credential. This is part of
        Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication and is the method by which
        Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::RemoteHTTP is loaded as the
        credential validator. For this module to be used, this must be set
        to 'RemoteHTTP'.

    url The URL that is used to authenticate the user. The module attempts
        to fetch this URL using a HEAD request (to prevent dragging a large
        page across the network) with the credentials given. If this fails
        then the authentication fails. If no URL is supplied in the config,
        then an exception is thrown on startup.

    username_field
        The field in the authentication hash that contains the username.
        This may vary, but is most likely 'username'. In fact, this is so
        common that if this is left out of the config, it defaults to
        'username'.

    password_field
        The field in the authentication hash that contains the password.
        This may vary, but is most likely 'password'. In fact, this is so
        common that if this is left out of the config, it defaults to
        'password'.

    username_prefix
        This is an optional prefix to the username, which is added to the
        username before it is used for authenticating to the remote http
        server. It may be used (for example) to apply a domain to the
        authenticated username.

    username_suffix
        This is an optional suffix to the username, which is added to the
        username before it is used for authenticating to the remote http
        server. It may be used (for example) to apply a domain to the
        authenticated username.

    http_keep_alive
        If "http_keep_alive" is set then keep_alive is set on the
        connections to the remote http server. This is required if you are
        using NTLM authentication (since an additional encryption nonce is
        passed in the http negotiation). It is optional, but normally
        harmless, for other forms of authentication.

    defer_find_user
        Normally the associated user store is queried for user information
        before the remote http authentication takes place.

        However if, for example, you are using a
        Catalyst::Authentication::Store::DBIx::Class store with the
        "auto_create_user" option, then you can end up with invalid users
        added to the store. If "defer_find_user" is set true then the remote
        http authentication occurs before the user is queried against the
        store, ensuring that any users passed to the store are known to be
        valid to the remote http server.

METHODS
    There are no publicly exported routines in the RemoteHTTP module (or
    indeed in most credential modules.) However, below is a description of
    the routines required by Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication for all
    credential modules.

  new( $config, $app, $realm )
    Instantiate a new RemoteHTTP object using the configuration hash
    provided in $config. A reference to the application is provided as the
    second argument.

  authenticate( $authinfo, $c )
    Try to log a user in, receives a hashref containing authentication
    information as the first argument, and the current context as the
    second.

JUSTIFICATION
    Why would you use this module rather than one of the similar ones?

    This module gives a combination of authentication against a remote http
    server, but maintains a local user store. This allows your
    authentication to be delegated, but the authorization (for example
    allocation and use of roles) to be determined by the local user store.

    Nearly all the other alternatives require you to combine your
    authentication and authorization databases.

    Catalyst::Authentication::Credential::HTTP::Proxy has a similar basis,
    but requires you to use HTTP basic authentication for the application,
    which may not be appropriate.

NTLM NOTES
    There are a number of issues relating to NTLM authentication. In
    particular the supporting modules can be rather picky. To make NTLM
    authentication work you must have an installed copy of libwww-perl that
    includes LWP::Authen::Ntlm (some linux distributions may drop this
    component as it gives you additional dependancy requirements over the
    basic LWP package).

    Additionally you require Authen::NTLM of version 1.02 or later. There
    are 2 different CPAN module distributions that provide this module - but
    only one of them has the appropriate version number.

    Finally, if you are using NTLM-1.02 then you need to apply the patch
    described in RT entry 9521
    <http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9521>.

    When using NTLM authenication the configuration option "http_keep_alive"
    must be set true - otherwise the session to the remote server is not
    maintained and the authentication nonce will be lost between sessions.

    You may also need to set "username_prefix" or "username_suffix" to set
    the correct domain for the authentication, unless the username as given
    to your application includes the domain information.
